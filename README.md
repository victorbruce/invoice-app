## 🚀 Getting Started
This project is built using Angular, SCSS, Typescript and hosted on Netlify.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Angular
- Typescript
- SCSS
- Jest

## 📦 Setup & Run Instructions
Clone the repository and run the command:

```sh
git clone <project>
cd <project>
```
Now, run the command:
`npm install` to install all the dependencies for the application

### Running the Application

#### Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

#### Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

#### Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

**Project Setup**

- I began by creating a new **Angular** project with **SCSS**
- I created a clean, modular folder structure to contain my **components**, **services**, and **shared utilities**
- Next, I updated the `README.md` docs to contain all valuable information such as how to **start** and **run** the project.
- Finally, I committed my changes to **GitHub** and hosted the project on **Netlify**

**Component Structure**

Inside **src/app/** we have:
- `core/`: contains app-wide **services**, **interceptors**, etc.

- `shared/`: contains **reusable** components, directives, pipes

Inside **/src/** we have:
- `styles`: contains organized **shared SCSS**
